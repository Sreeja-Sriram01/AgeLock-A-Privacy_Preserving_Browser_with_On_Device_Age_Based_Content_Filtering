AGELOCK : A PRIVACY PRESERVING BROWSER WITH ON DEVICE AGE BASED CONTENT FILTERING

ABSTRACT:

We present AgeLock , AgeLock Browser is a privacy-first desktop browser built on Electron, offering local, on-device filtering tailored to children (5–12), teens (13–17), and adults (18+). It enforces age-based content rules—strict for younger kids, moderate for teens, and minimal for adults—without sending browsing data to the cloud, ensuring no history collection or external telemetry. Users access broader content only via PINs or security question verification, and parents can further customize filters. Integrated search filtering and SafeSearch ensure age-appropriate results, while the built in video player intelligently detects and controls video playback. All functionality—from regex-based keyword filtering, URL classification, and DOM analysis, to secure PIN protection—is implemented client-side using modern web technologies (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript) and Electron, delivering robust, privacy protected age appropriate web access.

Keywords : Age-adaptive filtering, client-side security, explainable blocking, privacy-preserving, Zero-data-leakage architecture, DOM analysis, SafeSearch integration
